Introduction to Python:-
Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means that it can run on multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open-source.

Python Keywords:-
	Keywords are the reserved words in Python.

Python Identifiers:-
	An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. It helps to differentiate one entity from another.
	
Python Statement:-
	Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements. For example, a = 1 is an assignment statement.
Python Indentation:-
	A code block (body of a function, loop, etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. 
The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block.
	The enforcement of indentation in Python makes the code look neat and clean. 
This results in Python programs that look similar and consistent.

Python Comments:-
	They describe what is going on inside a program
In Python, we use the hash (#) symbol to start writing a comment.

Docstrings in Python:-
	A docstring is short for documentation string

Python Variables:-
	A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. 
It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program.

Boolean literals: True and False
special Literals:- None which is used to specify the field has not been created

Literal Collections:-
	There are four different literal collections List literals,
Tuple literals, Dict literals, and Set literals.

Python Numbers:-
	type of numbers:- int, float, complex
	type():- function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to
	isinstance() function is used to check if an object belongs to a particular class.

Python List:-It is mutable data type
List is ordered sequence of items.

Lists are mutable, meaning, the value of elements of a list can be altered.
 
Python Set:-
unordered collections

python dictionay:-
Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.

# Python Output Using print() function
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
Here, objects is the value(s) to be printed.

The sep separator is used between the values. It defaults into a space character.

After all values are printed, end is printed. It defaults into a new line.

The file is the object where the values are printed and its default value is sys.stdout (screen).

Python Import:-
	When our program grows bigger, it is a good idea to break it into different modules.
	A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Python modules have a filename and end with the extension .py

Special operators:-
	Python language offers some special types of operators like the identity operator or the membership operator. They are described below with examples.

Identity operators:-

is and is not are the identity operators in Python. 
They are used to check if two values (or variables) are 
located on the same part of the memory. 
Two variables that are equal does not imply that they are identical.

Membership operators:- 
in and not in are the membership operators in Python. 
They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set and dictionary).
